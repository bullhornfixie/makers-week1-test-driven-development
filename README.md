## What is RSpec?

RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, created for behaviour-driven
development (BDD). It is the most frequently used testing library
for Ruby in production applications. 

Behaviour-driven development is an idea built on top of TDD.

## What are the benefits of RSpec?

1) It builds a safety net against errors and increases your confidence!
2) It helps document your code. Your tests describe what your application should be doing.
3) It gives you a feedback loop. When you are doing TDD you get feedback which tells you what to fix next.
4) It helps you make sure your code is producing the results you expect.
